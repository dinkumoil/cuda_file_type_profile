================================================================================


1.0.6 (2020-06-25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

changed: Use new API PROP_ENC_RELOAD, thus it's not necessary anymore to update
         plugin if character encodings are added/removed in the future.



1.0.5 (2020-03-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

enhanced: Plugin ignores files which are part of a session or the file history.
          This way users can override automatically set file encoding and EOL
          format and it will be restored next time the file is opened.
          Requires at least CudaText v1.97.5.2

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

changed: Default settings file created after first launch of plugin now contains
         a profile for Linux shell scripts (file type .sh).
changed: If a file type's profile contains no valid settings, processing of INI
         file is stopped now instead of searching the file type in other
         profiles.
